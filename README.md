========

An alternative port of the "Wrye Bash" for Fallout 3/NewVegas.

---

This branch holds all the files that are unique to Wrye Flash / Flash NV and that must be added to Bash as part of work to add support for FO3 and FNV to Bash. The directory structure used mimics that of the latest Bash `master` source, though the diff used to determine the changes used Bash commit adc06d3c3ef0d8d335a91101979f030c3d5f9306 for comparison against the `master-newvegas-merge` branch. 

Where the latest Bash source is referenced, this refers to commit 9c20f9184f0b802051d5f60a9b65e7f25aa8661a at https://github.com/Utumno/wrye_bash_refactoring.git.

## Modified Files

Files that have been modified by Flash are present as diffs at this stage. These diffs will be edited to remove unnecessary changes. The changes to the files they reference in the Bash source since commit adc06d3c3ef0d8d335a91101979f030c3d5f9306 will be traced, and the changes in the diffs then applied as appropriate to the latest Bash source.

## New Files

Files in this branch that are not diffs are not present in the Bash source at commit adc06d3c3ef0d8d335a91101979f030c3d5f9306, and are also not present in the latest Bash source.
