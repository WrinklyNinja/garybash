========

An alternative port of the "Wrye Bash" for Fallout 3/NewVegas.

---

This branch holds all the files that are unique to Wrye Flash / Flash NV and that must be added to Bash as part of work to add support for FO3 and FNV to Bash. The directory structure used mimics that of Bash.

## WIP Files

Apart from these files, the content of this branch is ready for integration into the Bash repository.

`Mopy\Docs\Bashed Lists.html`
`Mopy\Docs\Bashed Lists.txt`
`Mopy\Docs\Wrye Flash (FNV).txt`
`Mopy\Docs\Wrye Flash (FO3).txt`
`Mopy\bash\l10n\Japanese (FNV-specific).txt`
`Mopy\bash\l10n\Japanese.txt`

The docs need to have any relevant info extracted and rewritten for inclusion into the Bash docs, and the Japanese translation files need to be combined and turned into gettext translation files.
