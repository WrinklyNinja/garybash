-
-An alternative port of the "Wrye Bash" for Fallout 3/NewVegas.
-
----
-
-I forked this with the following goals:
-
-1. To implement support for Bash Tag extraction from BOSS v3 masterlists.
-2. To investigate what the differences are between the Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas branches are, and see if it's possible to merge them into one.
-3. To investigate the differences between this and Wrye Bash, to see if it's possible to merge them.
-
-The first point is the main one though, I don't think I have the really willpower to slog through 2 and 3.
