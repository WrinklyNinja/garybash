## Bashed Lists

## Content

### Alchemical Catalogs

* Book catalogs of all alchemical ingredients sorted by ingredient name and effect. 
* These are updated versions of the allchemical catalogs found in `Cobl Main.esm` and will only be created if `Cobl Main` is included in the load list.

### Merged Lists

* Merged versions of currently conflicting lists.

## To Update

In Wrye Bash:

1. Select the mods you want to merge.
2. On the *Mods* tab, right-click the *Bashed Lists* plugin then select `Import: Merged Lists`.
3. In the resulting plugin, check **only** releveling mods. All mods displayed, checked or not, will be allowed to add new items to lists, but only the checked mods can remove items from the lists.
4. Click OK.

**Note:** If you have different load orders for different games, you can use a different *Bashed List` plugin for each. Just duplicate an existing plugin and update it with the desired load order.

## Notes

Bashed List plugins have other esp plugins as masters, so the GECK will not load it, though the game will.
